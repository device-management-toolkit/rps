The Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) enables the configuration and activation of IntelÂ® AMT devices based on a defined profile. RPS utilizes the [Remote Provision Client (RPC)](https://github.com/device-management-toolkit/rpc-go) deployed onto edge devices to connect the devices to the [Management Presence Server (MPS)](https://github.com/device-management-toolkit/mps) and enable remote manageability features.

<br><br>

**For detailed documentation** about Getting Started or other features of the Device Management Toolkit, see the [docs](https://device-management-toolkit.github.io/docs/).

<br>

## Prerequisites

To successfully deploy RPS, the following software must be installed on your development system:

- [Node.js\* LTS 18.x.x or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Deploy the Remote Provisioning Server (RPS) Microservice

To deploy the RPS on a local development system:

1. Clone the repo and switch to the `rps` directory.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/device-management-toolkit/rps.git && cd rps
   ```

2. Install the dependencies from the working `rps` directory.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the service.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. The RPS listens on port 8081 by default. Successful installation produces the command line message:

   ```
   RPS Microservice Rest APIs listening on https://:8081.
   ```

For detailed documentation about RPS, see the [docs](https://device-management-toolkit.github.io/docs/)

## Configuration

### PostgreSQL SSL/TLS Support

RPS supports secure connections to PostgreSQL databases using SSL/TLS certificates. To enable SSL support, configure the following environment variables or `.rpsrc` settings:

- `postgres_ssl_ca`: Path to the SSL Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file
- `postgres_ssl_cert`: Path to the SSL client certificate file  
- `postgres_ssl_key`: Path to the SSL client private key file
- `postgres_ssl_reject_unauthorized`: Whether to reject connections with invalid certificates (default: `true`)

**Example configuration:**

```json
{
  "connection_string": "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/rpsdb",
  "postgres_ssl_ca": "/path/to/ca-certificate.crt",
  "postgres_ssl_cert": "/path/to/client-certificate.crt", 
  "postgres_ssl_key": "/path/to/client-key.key",
  "postgres_ssl_reject_unauthorized": true
}
```

**Environment variable format:**
```bash
RPS_POSTGRES_SSL_CA=/path/to/ca-certificate.crt
RPS_POSTGRES_SSL_CERT=/path/to/client-certificate.crt
RPS_POSTGRES_SSL_KEY=/path/to/client-key.key
RPS_POSTGRES_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true
```

If no SSL certificate paths are provided, RPS will use a standard non-SSL PostgreSQL connection.

## Deploy with Docker and Run API Tests

We leverage [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and Docker for executing RESTful API tests. Once you have Postman and Docker installed, you can follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repo and switch to the `rps` directory.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/device-management-toolkit/rps.git && cd rps
   ```

2. Build the docker image.

   ```
   docker build -t rps-microservice:v1 .
   ```

3. Ensure RPS is running in a docker container.

   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Import the test collection located at `./src/test/collections/rps.postman_collection.json`.

5. Run the tests using the Collection Runner in postman. If any of the tests fail, file a github issue here: https://github.com/device-management-toolkit/rps/pull/34

## Using devcontainer

If you want debug in vscode devcontainer, try to open the project with devcontainer (Make sure you install the extension of **Dev Containers**)

- Step1: Press **Ctrl + Shift+ P** in vscode;
- Step2: Type **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**;
- Step3: Click the item which appear in column;
- Step4: Open a terminal, build and run app with command;
